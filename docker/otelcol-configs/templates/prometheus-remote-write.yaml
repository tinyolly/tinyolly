# Configuration with Prometheus Remote Write receiver
# Extends the default config to accept Prometheus remote write metrics
# in addition to OTLP. Useful for integrating Prometheus exporters and
# Prometheus-compatible clients that use the Remote Write protocol.
#
# The prometheusremotewrite receiver accepts metrics via Prometheus Remote Write v2 protocol.
# Clients should configure their remote_write endpoint to:
#   http://<collector-host>:19291/api/v1/write
#
# Reference: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusremotewritereceiver
