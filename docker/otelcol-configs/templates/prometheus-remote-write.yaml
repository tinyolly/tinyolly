# Default configuration with Prometheus Remote Write receiver
# Extends the default config to accept Prometheus remote write metrics
# in addition to OTLP. Useful for integrating Prometheus exporters.
# Note: This receiver is in alpha status. Prometheus must be started with
# --enable-feature=metadata-wal-records flag for proper functionality.
